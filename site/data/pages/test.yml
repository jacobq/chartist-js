                  By supplying the
                  <code>scalingTransformation</code>
                  option you can use logarithmic or (the default) linear scaling.
                  You can also provide your own transformation function and inverse for custom scale transformations.
                  For logarithmic scaling set
                  <code>options.scalingTransformation = Chartist.Transformations.logBase(b)</code>
                  where <code>b</code> is replaced by the number corresponding to the base to be used.
